  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p> Our audience will be the general public, from ages 8+ to 65.
    We will have our site be as user friendly as possible, so that
    it will be easily read by youth and adults, yet include more specific
    and techinal weather details for those who might need it for
    more professional reasons.
